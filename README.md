# More Trains Mod for Subway Builder
This is a mod adding more types of trains to Subway Builder.

To install, navigate to Settings -> Mod Manager -> Open Mods Folder in the game. This will open the mods directory on your computer. Place the more-trains folder in the mods directory. After this, enable the mod in the Mod Manager Settings page.

As of now, the only train added by the mod is an expensive, ultra-high-speed train capable of running approximately 140 kilometres an hour. It's useful for creating high-speed lines with few stops. For reference, the train is modelled after the Guangzhou Metro Line 18, which only has 9 stops on a 61km section.
